# Scripts
A collection of scripts that I have written for both personal and professional use. These scripts will be a mixture of standalone
scripts and Casper scripts (Policy Scripts & Extension Attributes). Each repository will have a readme that will list the files inside
and a brief description of what the script does and any other important information about the script.


- **Current Repository List**
  1. Apple Software Update Search *[Standalone]*
  2. Encrypt External Volume *[Casper Ready]*
  3. Rename Startup Volume *[Casper Ready]*

If you plan to use these scripts, I just ask that you credit my work and if possible, send me an email letting me know that you are using
it and any feedback or issues you may have.
